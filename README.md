# Student-GradeBook-Tracker

Generated a Java program to help my professor better understand their class grades, class average, best and worst grade, letter to numerical score, and many more!

- Applied OOP paradigms such as Polymorphism, Inheritance, Abstraction, Encapsulation, Objects, classes, etc to build a robust program that can handle many user input errors.

- Offers users the functionality of 13 different methods such as 'updating grades,' 'search for student,' 'find highest grade,' 'median class score,' 'mean class letter grade,' and so much more!


Student Grade Book Tracker for Professors, Teachers and TAs.
